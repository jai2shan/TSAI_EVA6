    "Assume that we moved our complete (cats vs dogs) image dataset to numpy arrays. Then we use torch.from_numpy to convert these images to tensor. Then we apply a specific data augmentation strategy called \"CutOut\" which blocks a portion of the image directly on these tensors. What will happen to the accuracy of a model trained on this strategy compared to the one without this strategy? CutOut strategy is shown below: \n",
